I am currently a fourth-year PhD candidate at Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU). I am also a member of joint Ph.D. program between XJTU and MSRA, advised by Prof. [Nanning Zheng](http://www.aiar.xjtu.edu.cn/info/1046/1229.htm) and Dr. [Bin Shao](https://www.binshao.info/). Before that, I received my Bachelor degree in 2019 from XJTU.
